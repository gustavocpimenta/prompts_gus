# INSPIRATIONAL_BOOKS

## "SuperBetter: The Power of Living Gamefully" by Jane McGonigal

*Why I love it*: This book reframes how we can approach challenges, setbacks, and personal growth by adopting a “gameful mindset.” McGonigal uses science‑backed strategies and real‑life stories to show how thinking like a gamer can foster resilience, creativity, and mental well‑being. I’m drawn to its playful yet profound approach to tackling life’s hurdles, making self‑improvement engaging and accessible.

## "Finite and Infinite Games" by James Carse

*Why I love it*: This philosophical masterpiece challenges how we view life, work, and play. Carse’s distinction between finite games (with clear winners, losers, and rules) and infinite games (focused on growth, connection, and continuation) inspires a transformative perspective on decision‑making and purpose. Its emphasis on infinite games highlights the value of collaboration, where the goal is not to win but to expand possibilities together. I appreciate its depth and how it encourages living more openly, creatively, and with a greater sense of shared purpose.

## "Atomic Habits" by James Clear

*Why I love it*: Clear’s practical, science‑based framework for habit formation is transformational. The book simplifies the process of building good habits and breaking bad ones into actionable steps, emphasizing the power of small, consistent changes. What truly stands out is its focus on systems—creating processes that make good habits inevitable and bad habits harder—and the transformative role of identity. By aligning habits with the person you want to become, Clear makes change not just achievable but deeply meaningful. It’s empowering, pragmatic, and resonates with my belief in lifelong learning and adaptability.

## "Awareness" by Anthony de Mello

*Why I love it*: This book offers a wake‑up call to live in the present and question conditioned ways of thinking. As a Catholic priest with an open mind, de Mello uniquely blends Western spirituality with Eastern philosophy, creating a profound and inclusive approach to self‑awareness. His mix of spirituality and psychology resonates deeply, encouraging a journey toward freedom, authenticity, and inner peace. Its conversational tone and transformative insights challenge me to see life and relationships with fresh eyes, fostering both personal and spiritual growth.

## "Master of Change: How to Excel When Everything Is Changing" by Brad Stulberg

*Why I love it*: Stulberg explores how to embrace change with grace and resilience. The book’s insights into the inevitability of change and strategies for thriving in uncertain times align closely with my focus on adaptability. I admire how it blends actionable advice with compelling stories, empowering readers to find strength and purpose amid transformation.

## Beyond Productivity: How AI is Rewriting our Relationship with Work

Hey there,

I've been a personal productivity geek forever.

It started with a simple realization: the world wasn't designed for people like me as a neurodivergent person. I had to take action. I had to create systems to navigate it.

Over time, I started creating systems for others and communities around personal productivity.

I consistently advocated meaningful productivity along this path. My work always started with “why,” and only then did I focus on “what” and “how.” Even so, I spent much time dealing with the “engines” of the systems I created.

Everything has changed dramatically in the past couple of years. Now, AI lets us outsource the boring stuff, focus on what drives us, and fully express our creativity.

Let's dive in.

### The AI Revolution

AI isn't just another tech trend; it's a revolution. It's faster, smarter, and more powerful than anything we've seen before. And that turns personal productivity upside down.

For generations, we've measured our worth by our ability to crush task lists and hit metrics. This way of thinking is fading.

With AI handling linear tasks, we're free to focus on what makes us uniquely human: creativity, original thinking, and authentic self-expression.

Not everyone is riding this wave yet, but as William Gibson reminds us, "The future is already here — it's just not evenly distributed yet."

Let's unpack how AI is opening new possibilities in our work lives.

## How AI Transforms the Way we Work

The ripple effects of AI touch every aspect of our professional lives, from how we handle routine tasks to how we learn and grow.

These key areas highlight its impact:

- Automation of routine tasks
    
    AI takes over tedious, repetitive work, such as scheduling meetings, drafting emails, and transcribing conversations. This frees individuals to focus on more strategic and creative initiatives.
    
- Better and faster decision-making
    
    AI’s ability to analyze vast datasets provides insights for better, faster decisions. These tools empower confident choices, highlight patterns, and identify risks and opportunities.
    
- Streamlined communication
    
    AI revolutionizes our interactions with real-time transcription, translation, and discussion summaries. These tools ensure transparent, efficient communication, keeping teams aligned and informed regardless of location or language barriers.
    
- Improved time management
    
    AI applications analyze work patterns and suggest optimal schedules, helping individuals prioritize high-impact activities. With tools that recommend task sequencing and highlight productivity peaks, managing time has never been easier.
    
- Personalized growth
    
    AI-powered learning platforms offer real-time feedback and resources that adapt to individual needs. They solve one of education's oldest challenges: personalized learning that adapts to each person's uniqueness.
    

While AI opens new possibilities and handles linear tasks, our current productivity tools don't fully address what we need from now on.

## Breaking the Checkbox: The Limits of Traditional Tools

Most productivity tools excel at one thing: convergence. They take ideas and narrow them down into actionable plans. They help you organize tasks, track progress, and meet deadlines. But here's the catch - they struggle with divergence, the messy but vital process of exploring new possibilities.

Consider organizing your taxes versus brainstorming your next big project. Tax prep needs structure and checklists. But innovation? That needs room to breathe, make unexpected connections, and follow curiosity down rabbit holes.

Traditional productivity tools feel like working in a cubicle when what we need is an artist's studio — a space where ideas can collide and creativity can flow.

But becoming more creative isn't just about better tools. It's about fundamentally rethinking how we create value in an AI-powered world.

### **Standing Out in The Age of AI**

Your riskiest move is playing it safe in a world where AI can generate decent content with a single prompt. Standing out isn't about efficiency anymore but embracing our unique humanity. It's about being:

- **Authentic**
    
    Grounded in real experiences and genuine passion, not algorithmic patterns.
    
- **Original**
    
    Making unexpected connections that spark new ways of seeing the world.
    
- **Emotionally resonant**
    
    Creating work that not only informs but moves people.
    
- **Awe-inspiring**
    
    Nurturing experiences that make people lose track of time and space.
    

In the AI age, our edge is not competing on speed or volume but creating work that carries the unmistakable signature of human creativity.

## **Making the Shift: A New Playbook**

If AI can handle productivity, what practices should we adopt to redefine our approach to work?

Here's how we can make the shift:

1. **Prioritize creativity over efficiency**
    
    Focus less on completing tasks quickly and more on producing meaningful, high-impact work. Ask yourself, "What unique value can I bring to this project?"
    
2. **Invest in divergent thinking tools**
    
    Explore technologies that inspire curiosity and connection. Tools designed for brainstorming, mind-mapping, or discovery can spark the serendipity that fuels innovation.
    
3. **Embrace non-linear workflows**
    
    Allow room for exploration and experimentation. Not every idea will succeed, but the process itself generates insights and growth.
    
4. **Celebrate the intangible**
    
    Recognize the unique value of wonder, authenticity, and emotional resonance. AI cannot replicate these elements.
    
5. **Cultivate adaptability**
    
    Build a comprehensive adaptability skill set that incorporates cognitive skills (critical thinking, problem-solving, etc), emotional and psychological skills (resilience, stress management, etc.), behavioral skills (flexibility, resourcefulness, etc.), social and interpersonal skills (collaboration, communication, etc.), and technological and systemic skills (digital literacy, systems thinking, etc.).
    
6. **Leverage collaborative intelligence**
    
    Blend human creativity with AI's capabilities. Treat it as a partner that improves ideas, deepens problem-solving, and opens new possibilities. Embrace AI agents as proactive collaborators that can anticipate needs, suggest new paths, and work alongside you to achieve goals — handling structured tasks and supporting the creative process.
    

### **Being Human in an Algorithmic World**

Adopting AI tools is an evolution, not a quick fix — it’s a process of discovery and adaptation.

The key to advancing in an AI-powered world lies in intentional integration. Take time to understand AI's capabilities, identify where it adds value, and deliberately design workflows that combine its efficiency with your unique insights and creativity.

When used intentionally, AI amplifies our human capabilities instead of replacing them.

It's not about doing less. It's about investing our time where it matters most — whether that's creating meaningful work that leaves a lasting impact or cherishing moments with loved ones.

What emerges isn't just a new way of working — it's a new way of being.

Stay strong, Gus

## 20 Lessons from 20 Years of Mentorship

Hey there,

Helping others succeed brings a unique joy that becomes addictive. The satisfaction comes from seeing their growth and knowing you played a part in it. Little did I know where this journey would lead me…

I didn't choose to be a mentor. People started referring to me as one over time. Only recently, after years of offering guidance for free (which I still do), did I start selling it as a service.

It's been a rewarding 20-year journey, time and again coming full circle. Former mentees have become friends and trusted advisors.

After doing it repeatedly, I've gained valuable insights. While there are many lessons to share, here are twenty that stand out:

1. Understand what drives them. Start there.
2. Trust them before they trust themselves. Be vocal about it.
3. Show them you care.
4. Adapt to each person; avoid preaching. It’s a collective journey, not an ego massage.
5. Help them set ambitious but realistic goals. They should stretch, not burn out pursuing the impossible.
6. Ask them to pay it forward by helping others who know less.
7. Mentors and mentees both grow. Mentees gain direction; mentors gain breadth.
8. Set high expectations and be there regardless of success or failure.
9. Remind them it’s okay to fail, but only if they make an effort.
10. Give constructive feedback. Tough love is part of it.
11. Active listening is as critical as giving advice.
12. Stimulate self-reflection and integration of what they learn in their daily practices.
13. Teach them to build systems to support their growth and explain how the effects compound over time.
14. Instill resilience. Recovering from setbacks is as important as moving forward.
15. Encourage questioning, objective analysis, and considering diverse perspectives to sharpen their critical thinking.
16. Show them obstacles are opportunities in disguise.
17. Remind them it’s okay to ask for help. It’s a strength, not a weakness.
18. Nurture adaptability. Welcoming change and pivoting trumps any other skill.
19. Be a sponsor. Introduce them to the right people. Sometimes, that alone can do the job.
20. Be a coach. Ask powerful questions as much as you give guidance.

Most of these lessons go beyond mentorship and apply to all forms of human connection, from friendships to romantic relationships. But here's the kicker: we're all experts at giving advice but struggle to follow it.

Stay strong, Gus

## On Personal Experiments

Hey there,

You could be living a better life. And for that, you don't need to win the lottery, be blessed by God, or follow any self-proclaimed guru's lessons.

The secret is to put yourself out there, try new things, learn the lessons, incorporate them into your life, and keep doing it intentionally.

I've been running personal experiments for some time, and recently, [one of them](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7171084825238466561/) radically changed how I work and opened up many opportunities. It was so impactful I realized I had to share more about personal experiments to help others kickstart their experimentation journeys.

Humans have been experimenting since the dawn of time. That's how we learn and evolve. It's also the foundation of scientific discovery, the operating principle of successful startups, and the way children learn.

Yet, when it comes to improving their own lives, many adults shy away from this approach. This hesitation often leads to ill-informed decisions when changes are finally made. Inexperienced experimenters tend to go all-in without properly testing and iterating on their ideas.

It doesn't have to be like this.

Let’s dive in.

### What are Personal Experiments?

Personal experiments are structured, time-bound tests where individuals try new behaviors or strategies to improve their lives. They involve creating a hypothesis, testing it, analyzing the results, reflecting, and integrating the learnings in your life.

It's a no-BS approach to personal growth: you don't blindly follow what others tell you to do; instead, you try things out for yourself.

Running personal experiments helps you become more self-aware, make better decisions, and improve your life by learning more about yourself and what works for you.

Here are some examples:

- Commit to completing one small project per day for 30 days, like a sketch or a short poem, to improve your creative skills.
- Add a 15-minute HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) workout to your morning routine for two weeks to boost fitness and energy.
- Log every expense and review your spending habits weekly for two months to better understand where you can cut costs and save more money.
- Work from the city you're considering moving to for a month. Better yet, rent a flat in the same neighborhood you're considering to get a feel for it.
- [Build three custom ChatGPTs in 30 days to improve your knowledge of AI](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7171084825238466561/) — the experiment I mentioned in the introduction.
- Work in a restaurant after your daily job for a couple of months before opening the restaurant you've been dreaming about or… realize you don't like the hospitality industry after all.

What do these experiments have in common? They are low-risk with the potential for high impact. You test the waters first, then double down if it works for you.

But it doesn't stop here…

The second-order effects are one of the most enriching parts of running personal experiments. When you change your regular behaviors, you uncover new possibilities you didn't think about. Doing it in public can exponentially increase the probability of that happening.

Let’s use my custom ChatGPTs experiment as an example. This experiment significantly improved my meaningful productivity and equipped me with various AI tools and processes for various purposes. It inspired new ideas to reposition my Fixed to Flow project and connected me with professionals I admire. Additionally, it sparked the idea of a new service for building GPTs for businesses and individuals, prompting me to build frameworks to conceptualize and manage GPTs—or any other AI assistant or agent. This experiment also generated business leads and led to an interview with Ness Labs, which was the trigger to reflect on the importance of being more vocal about the benefits of personal experiments.

The good news is that running experiments is pretty straightforward.

### Running Personal Experiments

After running countless personal experiments, I developed a [growth flywheel](https://gustavocpimenta.substack.com/p/from-fixed-to-flow) to keep me grounded and ensure my experiments were impactful. Its vectors are experimentation, diversity, reflection, and integration. You can check it in detail later. For now, let’s focus on actionable steps to get you started.

When choosing your first personal experiment, you can take a bottom-up or top-down approach. Both are valid and valuable, depending on your goals and preferences.

The bottom-up approach is intuitive: identify an area you want to improve, formulate a hypothesis to address it and test it through an experiment. This approach is perfect for tackling those specific, noticeable issues in your life.

In contrast, the top-down approach requires clarity about your life goals before picking experiments that help you reach them. This approach ensures that your experiments are purposeful and contribute to long-term growth.

Regardless of your chosen approach, here are some practical tips to help you get started:

- Start small to gain momentum and build your experimenter muscle.
- Draft a plan with your hypothesis, process, and timeline.
- Block time in your calendar for the experiment.
- Embrace accountability by sharing updates in public or having an accountability buddy.
- Document your journey with observations, insights, and reflections.
- Reflect, analyze, review findings, and extract key learnings.
- Integrate the learnings into your life.

I’m creating a Notion template to guide you through setting up and running personal experiments. It'll be ready for testing in a week or two. Let me know if you want to try it.

Happy experimenting!

Stay strong, Gus

## Notes from the Lab

Hey there,

Experiments have quietly taken over my life. Not in the mad scientist way (my friends might disagree), but how they become my default mode.

This experimental lens now colors (almost) everything I do, from evolving my AI and human skills courses to exploring new ways of being.

I’ve been pushing this philosophy further than ever. Experiments aren’t just projects anymore; they’re showing up in how I work, how I connect with others, and even how I challenge experimentation itself.

These are my notes from the lab, and the joy of stepping away from it.

### Learning by Doing
In my AI and human skills courses with Claro, I’ve been doubling down on the idea that learning only sticks if people keep experimenting after learning the foundations.

That’s why participants now leave with a 30-day experiment. They test new behaviors in their own work and report back with accountability. It makes the whole process more alive. More than a framework, it’s practice.

This all ties back to my own AI journey, which really kicked off with my 3 GPTs in 30 Days experiment. That project reminded me of the power of keeping curiosity on a short leash: instead of overthinking, you test, you build, and you adjust. Over and over again.

It’s come full circle: now I’m teaching others to embrace that same experimental mindset with AI.

### Fluid Communities
When I started The Cozy Sessions side project, my intention was simple: create spaces for deep conversations between diverse groups, away from the public noise.

Initially, I thought these dinners might grow into a structured community. I let that idea go, but I kept the dinners and discovered something else along the way.

I’m a heavy user of The Breakfast created by Eteri and Lisa. At first, it felt strange when they called it a community. It didn’t look like the structured communities I knew. But their idea of community gave me a taste of something different, lighter, more fluid, that fits me.

My dinners have guests from The Breakfast app, my various work circles, creative communities, and many other different worlds. These collisions of different social ecosystems create conversations that wouldn’t exist otherwise.

Maybe communities today don’t always need structure. Sometimes they’re simply the connections that emerge, in between, when curiosity brings people together.

My closest relationships, my inner circle, are what I value most in life. But they’re not enough for me. There’s something energizing about connecting with new people, sharing perspectives, hanging out spontaneously, staying open to the new. These fluid communities are perfect for that.

In a beautiful contradiction, I found this by experimenting with the absence of control.

### The Last Year of My Life
Meanwhile, my personal experiments keep rolling on. Some work hit the mark some crash and burn, but all of them add something to the mix.

More recently, I’ve been experimenting not just within my framework but with the framework itself, trading rigid structure for flow, detailed planning for space to be surprised.

One experiment stands out among all my experiments: The Last Year of My Life (not as dramatic as it sounds). It’s pushed me to embrace uncertainty and let go of the very structures I once relied on.

I’ve been hesitant to share it because it cuts so close to the bone, but maybe that hesitation is just another experiment waiting to happen.

### The Joy of Stillness
Experimentation isn’t just for its own sake. It’s a way to explore what we want to improve or change. But experiments also help us decide, settle, and stabilize.

Funny thing about writing about experiments: it makes you notice when experimentation gets preached like a new religion. Even as an experimenter, I reject this endless hunger for more.

Experiments fuel my learning and curiosity, and probably always will. But when they become personal, sometimes experimenting means finding what’s already there. Enough becomes the answer.

What’s more powerful: endlessly reaching for more, or finding joy in someone’s eyes looking directly at you?

Sometimes the most radical experiment is stillness itself.

Stay strong, Gus


# EXAMPLES_LINKEDIN_POSTS

## ChatGPT Memory

Most people are using ChatGPT's new memory feature without even realizing it.

It's on by default, and most people don't change the defaults. That means the AI remembers your past chats unless you tell it not to.

I'm loving it, though it does come with some meaningful trade-offs. Especially the fact that using it means willingly sharing information with OpenAI.

That said, you're always in control. You can turn memory off anytime. You can also use temporary chats (think incognito mode for AI).

Whatever you choose, don’t just stick with the default.

Always make a conscious decision about how you show up with these tools.

## Meetings

The look on people's faces when a meeting ends early... it's a small, quiet kind of joy.

Lately, I've been trying to make that happen more often. It feels like giving people (and myself) the gift of time.

Good meetings fall into two camps: short and sharp — 15 to 20 minutes max — or long and deep — two hours or more. Quick check-ins or full-on collaborative jams. Most of what sits in the middle is often just a waste of time.

Meetings shouldn't fill space. They should make it.

## Amanda Askell

I once said designers would rule the world until philosophers took over. Looks like that moment has arrived. 🤓

Meet Amanda Askell, known as the 'Claude whisperer' at Anthropic. She's the philosophical mind behind Claude's distinctive personality, which is why many praise its thoughtful, honest approach.

In this fascinating interview featuring three Anthropic leaders, you'll discover how a philosopher's touch shapes the future of AI interaction.

## Infinite Missions, from the Manhattan project to the AI race

*"I am willing to go bankrupt rather than lose this race."
— Larry Page (Google Co-Founder)*

When missions touch infinity, business-as-usual breaks down. These projects run on different rules — longer timelines, highly engaged talent, and focus on progress over cost.

Historically, governments have led these missions. But now, Big Tech sees AGI as an existential race. Tech giants are willing to go all in, even facing bankruptcy, to win.

Both approaches drive spillover innovations that benefit us all but also bring new risks.

This fascinating piece by @Packy McCormick explores this pattern through history (link in the comments).

## Smuggling AI into work

When business leaders ask me about driving AI adoption, I smile Why? Many employees are already "smuggling" AI into their work. I'm not referring to those using it for small tasks but to the ones who supercharge significant portions of their roles.

Remember when Reddit had stories of employees automating their jobs, sometimes going undetected for years? Imagine what might be happening now on a much larger scale…

Don't shut down these AI 'smugglers' – celebrate them. They are the examples to follow.

Worry less about the AI adopters and more about those who haven't shown the curiosity or initiative to follow in these smugglers' footsteps.

Celebrating smugglers is just one of many necessary steps, but it’s a great starting point.

P.S.

And yes, many try to do this but are sloppy and careless. If the quality of their work is worse than before, they are not smugglers; they are replicators.

## **Will generalists own the future? Well, yes and no**

Dan Shipper wrote a concise yet insightful piece on why generalists will own the future (link in the comments). As a generalist with some solid skills, I probably should be inclined to agree, but the reality is more nuanced.

Generalists will finally gain well-deserved recognition, but specialists will remain essential. However, this debate often overlooks a critical factor: the growing importance of proximity professions.

I'm talking about caregivers, osteopaths, shamans, babysitters, yoga teachers, and many others - professions that keep us connected, supported, and evolving as human beings.

Thoughts?

# EXAMPLES_X_POSTS

AI alone won't collapse the talent stack — but adaptable generalists who use AI as a tool (not a crutch) while honing their human skills sharp will.
